        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Mushroom Bisque is a velvety, indulgent soup that celebrates the earthy flavors of mushrooms. Sauteed with onions and garlic, the mushrooms create a rich and robust basem while a touch of thyme addes depth. Blended to a creamy texture and infused with either cream or a non-dairy alternative, this comforting bisque deights the palate with its smoothness. A drizzle of truffle oil or a sprinkle of chives elevates its presentation, making it a perfect choice for a luxurious appetizer or a comforting meal on its own.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) fresh mushrooms (white, cremini, or a mix), sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups (1 liter) vegetable or chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) heavy cream or half-and-half</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: fresh chopped parsley, a drizzle of truffle oil, or a dollop of sour cream.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saute until they become translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, being careful not to let it brown.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook the mushrooms until they release their moisture and start to brown, stirring occasionally. This should take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the mushrooms have browned, season with dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine the flavors.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Push the mushrooms and onions to one side of the pot, creating an empty space. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the empty space and let it melt. Once melted, sprinkle the flour over the butter and whisk it together to form a roux. Cook the roux for about a minute to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour the vegetable or chicken broth into the pot while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Using an immersion blender or transferring the soup in batches to a blender, puree the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, be cautious with hot liquids, and blend in small batches to avoid splatters.</li>
            <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream or half-and-half. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed. Let the soup simmer for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnishing each bowl with optional toppings like fresh chopped parsley, a drizzle of truffle oil, or a dollop of sour cream.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your delicious and comforting mushroom soup!</li>
        </ol>
