        <h1>Greek Gyro</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>A Greek gyro is a mouthwatering culinary delight that embodies the essence of Mediterranean cuisine. Tender slices of seasoned meat, often lamb, chicken, or pork, are meticulously layered onto a vertical rotisserie, allowing them to slow-cook to succulent perfection as they spin and develop an irresistible outer crispness. Once cooked, these savory shavings are nestled within a warm and soft pita bread, accompanied by a symphony of vibrant toppings like freshly diced tomatoes, crunchy onions, and crisp lettuce. The ensemble is harmonized by a dollop of creamy tzatziki sauce, a tangy blend of yogurt, cucumber, and herbs, infusing every bite with a cooling, herbaceous zing. A Greek gyro is a culinary masterpiece that seamlessly combines textures and flavors, offering a tantalizing taste of Greece's rich culinary heritage.</p>

        <ol>

        <li><h4>Prepare the Gyro Meat</h4></li>

        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, paprika, salt, pepper, and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the thinly sliced meat to the bowl and toss to coat the meat evenly with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for stronger flavor).</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, grated and drained cucumber, minced garlic, lemon juice, chopped dill, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Cook the Gyro Meat</h4></li>

        <ul>
            <li>Preheat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the marinated meat slices for a few minutes on each side until they are cooked through and have a nice browned exterior. Cooking time will vary depending on the type of meat and thickness of slices.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Assemble the Gyros</h4></li>

        <ul>
            <li>Warm the pita bread in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
            <li>Place a few slices of cooked meat in the center of each pita.</li>
            <li>Top with sliced tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, and lettuce.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a generous amount of tzatziki sauce over the toppings.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><h4>Roll and Serve</h4></li>

        <ul>
            <li>Fold the sides of the pita over the fillings and then roll it up tightly from the bottom, creating a gyro wrap.</li>
            <li>Secure with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil, and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>

        </ol>
